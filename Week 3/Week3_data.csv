Are you a fan of low learning curves with high returns? Whether for a class, a personal project, your research, or just for personal interest, Python might be for you! In this Open Lab, ASU Library's Abi Mercado Rivera will introduce you to the fundamentals of Python, an open source programming language that has gained significant traction among students and researchers from all majors! Our workshop is directed at anyone interested in learning Python and will be taught at a beginner’s level. You will learn basic notation in Python (a.k.a. how you tell the computer what to do), how functions work (code that runs only when you want), and how to introduce packages to supercharge your work. We will also be writing and running short programs together to get you started in the world of Python. No previous coding experience is required!
